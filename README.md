### Objective 1: 
Constructed an analysis notebook using Python and Pandas as comprehensive tools to analyze and visualize significant metrics derived from historical daily returns of multiple portfolios. This analysis covered the period from 2015 to 2019 and focused on investment portfolios associated with the following entities:

  1. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC
  2. PAULSON & CO.
  3. SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC
  4. TIGER GLOBAL MANGEMENT LLC

### Objective 2: 
Developed a diversified custom portfolio comprising stocks from reputable companies, specifically Apple Inc. (AAPL), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), based on historical quantitative analyses.
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the custom investment portfolio by calculating the annualized standard deviation to assess volatility and risk exposure. Visualized rolling standard deviation with a 21-day window to identify volatility patterns within the portfolio. Determined correlations with other portfolios to unveil relationships and dependencies. Computed the beta against the S&P/TSX 60 index to assess market-related risk exposure. Derived Sharpe ratios in a visual bar plot to evaluate risk-adjusted returns. Collectively, these analyses aimed to provide a holistic understanding of the portfolio's performance, risk characteristics, and relative position compared to market benchmarks, contributing valuable insights for strategic investment decision-making.

#### Risk Analysis
- Box plots were generated for each portfolio's returns, aiding in visualizing the spread and variability.
- Standard deviation calculations were executed for each portfolio, allowing for a comparative risk evaluation against the S&P 500 benchmark.
- Annualized standard deviation metrics were derived to capture a longer-term risk perspective.
#### Rolling Statistics
- Rolling standard deviations were computed and visualized using a 21-day window, providing insights into volatility trends.
- Correlations between individual portfolios and the S&P 500 were established, identifying the mimicking or diverging behavior.
- Specific portfolio analysis involved calculating and illustrating the 60-day rolling beta against the S&P 500.
#### Rolling Statistics Challenge: Exponentially Weighted Average
- An alternative approach via exponentially weighted moving averages was explored, utilizing a 21-day half-life to interpret recent observations with greater significance.
#### Sharpe Ratios
- Sharpe ratios were meticulously computed based on daily returns, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of risk-adjusted returns.
- Visualization of Sharpe ratios in a bar plot format facilitated a clear comparative view of portfolio performances against the S&P 500 and other whale portfolios.
